â˜• Ahwa Manager

Ahwa Manager is a simple Flutter app for managing coffee shop orders.
The main goal of this project is not the design but rather to practice OOP principles and apply SOLID clean architecture in a real project.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

Practice applying OOP in Flutter (classes, inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, composition).

Implement SOLID clean architecture to improve code readability, testability, and maintainability.

Build a small but structured app that demonstrates how principles can be applied to a real project.

ðŸ§© OOP Principles in Action

Encapsulation â†’ Models like Drink, Order, and User manage their own state and behaviors.

Abstraction â†’ Applied in OrdersRepo and ReportRepo.

Polymorphism â†’ Different repo implementations can be used interchangeably.

ðŸ”‘ SOLID Principles Applied

S (Single Responsibility Principle) â†’ Each class, like OrdersRepoImpl, has one clear responsibility.

O (Open/Closed Principle) â†’ New drink types can be added without modifying existing code.

L (Liskov Substitution Principle) â†’ Any repo implementation can substitute another without breaking functionality.

I (Interface Segregation Principle) â†’ Repos were split into smaller contracts like OrdersRepo and ReportRepo.

D (Dependency Inversion Principle) â†’ Cubits depend on abstractions (Repo) instead of concrete implementations.

ðŸ“Œ The app allows you to:

Add new orders with customer name, drink type, and special instructions.

Track orders (pending & completed).

Mark orders as completed.

Generate simple reports such as top-selling drinks.
